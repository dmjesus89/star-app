        <p>There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted (if applicable):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Items with obvious signs of use</li>
          <li>Any item not in its original condition is damaged, or missing parts for reasons not due to our error</li>
          <li>Any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery will be deemed as non-returnable items</li>
